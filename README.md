Dockerising a simple REST-API which counts the number of visiters and performs simple operations suchs as "Addition","Subtraction", "Multiplication" and "Division" on two numbers received via POST method.

Visiter count is connected to mongoDB to store its value.

To run:
        Goto Docker directory
        sudo docker-compose build
        sudo docker-compose up

        Use Postman to send the POST values and also to check its output.
